        <h2>1. Squash and Stretch</h2>

        <center> <img width = "500" src = "images/squashandstretchmine.PNG"> </center>
        <p>The squash and stretch principle is considered the most fundamental of the 12 principles of animation.
        Squash and stretch is defined as the changing shapes of an object or character to emphasize their speed, momentum, weight, elasticity, and mass.
        This principle helps to illustrate the properties of the object and give it a more life-like appearance through imitating and
        exaggerating the outside forces acting on it, such as gravity.</p>

        <p>For example, when a rubber ball bounces, it stretches horizontally on impact with the ground and vertically when it is travelling.
        The changing shape of the ball illustrates its mass and elasticity to make it more life-like.
        On the other hand, a bowling ball will not squash and stretch because it is made of a stiffer material. </p>

        <center><img width = "485" src = "images/sandsfacemine.PNG"></center>
        <p>This principle can also be applied to facial expressions.</p>

        <p>Note: be careful when using this technique and keep the object's volume constant.
        When an object squashes, it gets wider. When an object stretches, it gets longer.
        Otherwise, the object size will appear to be changing and it will lose its realism.</p>

        <h2>2. Anticipation</h2>


        <p>An action happens in three steps; the preparation, the execution, and the follow-through.
        Anticipation is the illustration of a character’s posing and movement in preparation for the execution.
        This principle helps the audience to predict what will happen and makes the action more believable.</p>

          <center><img width = "500" src = "images/anticipation.PNG"></center>
        <p>Anticipation can be applied to any action. Before someone jumps they crouch down to build energy then they spring up.
          If the crouch of the animation was not illustrated, the jump would look unrealistic as no momentum was built up.
          Consequently, the motion becomes awkward, bland, and lifeless.</p>

          <center><img width = "300" src = "images/anticipationsurprise.PNG"></center>
        <p>Anticipation can also be used to manipulate the audience’s attention.
          If a character looks to the right, the viewers’ eyes will follow.
          By controlling where the audience is looking, you can surprise them by manipulating their focus in the opposite direction.</p>

        <h2>3. Staging</h2>

        <p>Staging involves presenting a scene through movement, composition, timing, acting, the setting, and the camera’s angles and positions to achieve full control of where the audience looks.
          Staging makes the purpose of the animation completely and unmistakably clear by drawing the viewers’ focus away from the non-important elements thus, avoiding confusion.</p>
        
          <center><img width = "500" src = "images/stagingboat.PNG"></center>
          <p>To effectively apply this technique:<br></p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Have a limited amount of actions happening at once to avoid confusing the audience.</li>
            <li>2. Utilize camera angles and positions to frame the primary action effectively.</li>
            <li>3. Simplify the setting as much as possible to not compete with the main focus.</li>
            <li>4. Have the main action be in the center of the screen or in one of the thirds.</li>
            <li>5. Let one action finish before starting another to allow the audience to fully comprehend what is happening and not have their eyes travel across the screen too much.</li>
            <li>6. Insert pauses if there is something on the screen that viewers need time to process, such as text.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>4. Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose Animation</h2>

        <p>Straight ahead and pose to pose are the two techniques used to draw animations.</p>

        <center><img width = "500" src = "images/straightaheadmine.png"></center>
        <p>In straight ahead animation, each frame is drawn in consecutive order from the first to the last drawing of the scene.
          This creates fluid, fresh and zany-looking animations as the process is more creative.
          This process is typically used for more unpredictable, wild, scrambling actions to illustrate its spontaneity.</p>

        <center>  <img width = "500" src = "images/posetoposemine.PNG"></center>
        <p>Pose-to-pose animation involves planning the action and determining which poses and placements are needed to convey the movement.
          This is done by drawing the beginning, end, and key frames first.
          Afterwards, the other frames are drawn in. Pose- to-pose animating gives animators more control of the scene by allowing them to control the timing, poses,
          and placement, as well as the proportions, size, and volume of the objects.
          These benefits can increase the dramatic effect of the motion. </p>

          <h2>5. Follow Through and Overlapping Action</h2>

            <center><img width = "500" src = "images/overlappingmine.png"></center>
          <p>When an object is moving, its main body will move at different speeds compared to its separate parts;
            they do not move parallel or in sync with each other.
            This same idea is applicable to when an object stops moving, this is called overlapping.
            For example, when a dog is running, their ears will go up as their main body falls.</p>

            <center><img width = "300" src = "images/heromine.PNG"></center>
          <p>Additionally, when a character stops, their secondary parts such as their limbs, hair, and tail do not stop at the same time, instead, they catch up to the main mass and stop afterwards.
            For example, a superhero's cape will settle beside them after they have landed.
            This is called follow-through.</p>

          <p>Overlapping and follow-through apply to any moving object and work together to make the movement appear more graceful and realistic.
            In real life, this is called inertia. </p>

        <div class = "customTEXT">
          <customTEXT>
            <h2>6. Slow-out and Slow-in </h2>

            <p>Objects and characters do not move at a constant speed.
              When an action begins, the speed of the object or character speeds up as it gains momentum and when it stops, it slows down.
              If the object or character moves at a constant speed, it would seem unnatural and robotic. </p>

              <center><img width = "300" src = "images/slowinoutmine.PNG"></center>
            <p>In animation, this is achieved by changing the spacing of the inbetween drawings between the extreme poses.
              To have an action appear to accelerate in speed as it begins, the spacing between each drawing will continue to become larger.
              Whereas, when an object comes to a stop, the spacing between each drawing will slowly decrease.
              More spacing between frames will make the action faster while less will have the action appear slower.
              This is called slow-out and slow-in.</p>

            <p>Slow-out and slow-in help the action appear more smooth, soft, and life-like.</p>

            <h2>7. Arcs </h2>

            <p>Most objects, especially living creatures, move in an arc or a slightly circular path.
              An exemption to this movement are mechanical devices, they move in straight, stiff lines.
              Thus, to make movements in animations appear more smooth, expressive, and natural, arcs are used. </p>

              <center><img width = "500" src = "images/arcsmine.PNG"></center>
              <p>For example, when someone walks, their heads bobs up and down in an arc motion and their limbs move in an arc as well.</p>

              <center>  <img width = "500" src = "images/ballarcmine.PNG"></center>
              <p>When a ball is thrown in the air, it follows an arc as gravity acts on it. </p>
              <center>  <img width = "500" src = "images/heavyarcmine.PNG"></center>
              <p>Arcs can be used to illustrate weight.</p>
            </customTEXT>

            <customTEXT>
              <h2>8. Secondary Action</h2>

              <center><img width = "300" src = "images/tonguemine.PNG"></center>
              <p>A secondary action is a gesture that supports or emphasizes the main action.
                This can include adding small mannerisms to a character like licking their lips before eating cake to show their excitement, chewing the end of a pencil when writing a
                test to portray their stress, or whistling while walking down the street to show their ease.
                These actions add realism, complexity, and interest to the animation as well as add more dimension to the character.</p>

              <center><img width = "300" src = "images/crymine.PNG"></center>
              <p>However, it is crucial to keep the secondary action subtle and not distract from or cover the primary action.
                For this reason, staging is very important for secondary action. Above, the character’s hands and tissue is covering the primary action; their sad facial expression.</p>

            <div class = "customTEXT">
              <customTEXT>
                <h2>9. Timing</h2>

                <center><img width = "1000" src = "images/timingmine.PNG"></center>
                <p>Timing refers to the speed of an action and is a very important aspect of animation.
                The speed of an action is controlled by the number of frames inserted between each main action:
                less drawings between them will give the illusion of a fast-moving object and less will make the speed appear slow.
                Different speeds of a movement can alter how the audience understands the action and how realistic the movements are.
                For example, if a character walks slowly, the audience may think they are relaxed but if a character is walking quickly, they will think the character is in a rush. </p>

                <p>Additionally, the speed of an object helps to illustrate its weight. If an object falls from a table quickly, the viewers will perceive it is heavy.
                If it falls slowly, the viewers will think the object is light. However, the speed of the object must correspond with the object.
                If a brick falls too slowly or a feather falls too quickly it will not be realistic. </p>

                <p>Timing can also make a piece more entertaining by syncing movements to music or by adding suspense by delaying some frames.</p>

                <center><img width = "500" src = "images/scared.PNG"></center>
                <p>Sometimes, too much realism in an animation can make it static and boring.
                Thus, to make it more dynamic, a character’s movements or facial expressions can be pushed further, exaggerated.
                Exaggeration can also help to illustrate the story more clearly, give more depth to a character, or have the piece appear more cartoony. </p>

                <p>However, too much exaggeration can make the animation become too aggressive and theatrical at the cost of realism.
                Thus, use the principle of exaggeration with restraint. </p>

                <h2>11. Solid drawing</h2>

                  <center><img width = "500" src = "images/3Dmine.PNG"></center>
                  <p>The principle of solid drawing utilizes anatomy, volume, balance, weight, perspectives, light, and shadows to create the illusion of a three-dimensional world.</p>

                  <p>While the limits of solid drawing can be pushed in animation, such as having warped perspectives,
                  it is important to keep that perspective constant throughout to make the imaginary world more believable. </p>

                  <center><img height = "350" src = "images/soliddrawingminesword.PNG"><img height = "350" src = "images/linesmine.PNG"></center>
                  <p>Additionally, to have the animation appear more natural and dynamic, avoid pairing parallel lines.
                  Instead, pair a straight line with a curved line.
                  Moreover, avoid creating mirrored poses in characters, “twinning.” For example, having both arms in their pockets or on their hips.
                  This creates a boring and unrealistic look as the character no longer appears to have weight and balance in their three-dimensional environment.</p>

                  <h2>12. Appeal</h2>

                  <center><img width = "1000" src = "images/appealmine.PNG"></center>

                  <p>Characters in an animation need to have appeal. Otherwise, viewers would not be interested in the animation.
                    Whether the character’s charisma comes from their good-looks, their friendliness, how interesting they are to look at, or their uniqueness, all characters need to be likable, even villains.
                    However, there is no set formula for the principle of appeal as there is no standard for what the population finds pleasing.
                    Despite this, appeal comes from simplicity, charm, personality, strong character development, a pleasing design, and the ability to illustrate a compelling story.
                    Some factors to consider when applying appeal to characters includes: </p>

                  <h3>Use a Variety of Shapes</h3>
                  <p>Instead of using the same basic shapes to create a character, use a variety of shapes to add interest to them and make them more unique.
                    Different shapes even help to express the character’s personality while making the animation less boring.</p>

                  <h3>Play with Proportions</h3>
                  <p>To create more unique and appealing designs, artists often exaggerate a character’s physical features.
                    For example, to make a character seem more innocent and youthful, artists will give them larger eyes.
                    To make a character appear intimidating, artists will make them taller and more muscular.
                    Through playing with proportions, one can further define a character’s personality.</p>

                    <h3>Keep it Simple</h3>
                    <p>A character’s design can also be enhanced through details such as clothing which can aid in expressing their personality.
                      For example, an elderly character can have a cane and glasses to illustrate their old age and an outdoorsy character can have hiking boots and a compass around their neck.
                      However, a design that is too complicated can distract from their personality and seem too busy. Also, too many details will make the character difficult to animate.
                      Whereas a design that is too simple lacks interest and character</p>

                    <h3>Posing</h3>
                    <center><img width = "300" src = "images/posingmine.PNG"></center>
                      <p>A character’s poses can also strengthen their design and portray their personality.
                        In the example above, to make Santa look more imposing, he is considerably larger than the elf and has his hands on his hips. </p>
