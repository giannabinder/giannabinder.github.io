                <center><img width = "500" src = "images/zoetrope.png"></center>
              <p>The zoetrope was a popular entertainment device in the Victorian era. It was first invented by mathematician William Horner in 1834 who named it the Daedalum.
                However, after regaining popularity in 1867, it was renamed the zoetrope and patented by William Lincoln. </p>

              <p>The zoetrope is made up of a cylinder with vertical slots on its sides and has sequential drawings on the inside.
                When the zoetrope spins, the slits allow viewers to see the passing drawings on the device’s inside while creating the illusion of movement.</p>



            <br><br><h2>Kinetoscope</h2>
              <h4>Videos:</h4>

                <center><img width = "500" src = "images/kinestoscope.png"></center>
              <p>The kinetoscope was invented by Thomas Edison and William Dickson in 1891.
                The machine was composed of a strip of film which passed between a lens and a lightbulb, and a peephole for a viewer to see the life-like representation of motion.</p>

              <p>Edison thought the kinetoscope was merely an insignificant toy and only secured a U.S. patent for it.
                Sadly, after it was exhibited on Broadway in 1894 the kinetoscope became a success and several were sold in Europe.</p>

              <p>The kinetoscope was the forerunner of modern motion-picture film.</p>

                <center><img width = "500" src = "images/mutoscope.png">
                <h5>Mutoscope</h5></center>
              <p>In Birmingham, England 1868, the first flipbook appeared when John Barnes Linett, an English lithograph printer, patented his invention the kineograph meaning “a moving picture.”
                The kineograph was the first type of animation which utilized a linear sequence of images to create the illusion of motion. In 1894, Herman Casler invented the mutoscope,
                a mechanized flipbook mounted on a gyrating cylinder.</p>

              <p>The flipbook uses several pieces of bound paper illustrating sequential drawings.
                To animate the images, the book is flicked through and the passing images create the illusion of movement. </p>



            <br><br><h2>Rotoscoping</h2>
              <h4>Videos:</h4>

              <center><img width = "800" src = "images/rotoscopinggreen.png"></center>
              <p>Rotoscoping, or performance capture, is a technique that uses a live-action video as a template to trace for the animation.
                Photographs of the live-action film were originally traced by hand on a roll of celluloid film. This technique enables animated movements to be realistic.</p>

              <center><img width = "500" src = "images/rotoscoping.png"></center>
              <p>Max Fleischer used this technique first in 1915, he created a character named Koko the Clown modelled by his brother.
                The three shorts he animated became a sensation and he went to make his own company, Fleischer Studios, which created characters such as Betty Boop and Popeye.</p>

              <center><img width = "800" src = "images/rotoscopingsnowwhite.png"></center>
              <p>Walt Disney even adopted Fleischer’s technique to create some of his films including Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).</p>

              <center><img width = "800" src = "images/polarexpressrotoscope.jpg"></center>
              <p>Today, rotoscoping is a widely used technique for digital animations, films, and video games.
                For example, The Polar Express (2004) and Avatar (2009) connected actors to a computer that tracked and transformed their movements into a skeleton.
                Next, the animation was mapped to the skeleton which created the character.</p>



            <br><br><h2>Photographic stills</h2>
              <h4>Videos:</h4>
                <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_HXUhShhmY" target="_blank"> Her Morning Elegance / Oren Lavie</a><br><br><br>

                <center><img width = "500" src = "images/photographicstills.png"></center>
              <p>This animation technique involves using a series of photographs instead of digitally drawn images.
                Each photo is slightly different from the last and when viewed in order, they appear to be moving.
                The photographs include regular photos or ones with drawings on them.</p>


              <br><br><h2>Stop motion</h2>
                <h4>Videos:</h4>

                <p>Stop motion animation is created by capturing the sequential movements of physical objects one frame at a time.
                  Between each frame, the objects are moved very slightly. When the photographs are viewed in order, the captured object will give the impression of moving.</p>

                <center><img width = "500" src = "images/coraline.png"></center>
                <p>Albert E. Smith and J.Stuart Blackton were the first to be credited for applying this technique with their 1898 animation, The Humpty Dumpty Circus.
                  Some noticeable stop motion films today include The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), Coraline (2009), The Little Prince (2016), and Kubo (2016).</p>

                <center><img width = "500" src = "images/corpsebride.png"></center>
                <p>Note, to make the animation appear smoother, have the FPS be shorter and the movements be as little as possible.</p>

                  <img width = "400" src = "images/armatureclaymature.png"></center>
                <p>Claymation is a form of stop motion that utilizes plasticine to create characters and sometimes backgrounds.
                  Between each frame, the clay figurines are moved slightly which gives the appearance of movement when the frames are played in quick succession.
                  To help achieve this motion, the moving figures are created on wire skeletons called armatures.
                  Additionally, they will remain correctly placed and lit on the scene at all times to preserve continuity.</p>

                <center><img width = "400" src = "images/claymation.png"></center>
                <p>The Sculptor’s Nightmare, 1908, is the earliest preserved claymation. However, this art form dates back to 1897.
                  Modern leaders in this field is the Aardman Animations company, they are responsible for producing the Wallace and Gromit films.</p>

                  <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46Mlr4hvW-E" target="_blank"> Bird and Cage Thaumatrope</a><br>

                <p>The thaumatrope is constructed from a card with a picture on either side which is attached, at both ends, with separate pieces of string.
                  To create the appearance of movement, the strings are twirled rapidly to allow the card to spin once the strings’ tension is released. </p>

                <center><img width = "500" src = "images/thaumatrope.png"></center>
                <p>The thaumatrope was invented in 1825 by the English physician John Ayrton Paris.
                  It is the first instrument to use the optical phenomenon of persistence of vision to animate still images.</p>

                <p>Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) is a popular technology used today in many industries from entertainment to engineering.
                  CGI includes many types of visual effects such as using greenscreens to create a setting or creating 3D models of monsters which are later put into live-action scenarios.
                  CGI is also used to add more textures, objects, structures, or characters to the environment.
                  Thus, a broad definition of CGI is; the process of using computer applications to create or augment visual content, still or animated.
                  The content created can be either 2D or 3D.</p>

                <center><img width = "500" src = "images/toystoryCGI.png"></center>
                <p>CGI goes back to the 1950s and was first utilized in a feature film in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo.
                  3D computer graphics were later introduced with Edwin Catmull and Fred Parke’s short film, A Computer Animated Hand.
                  Today, CGI has progressed rapidly and is now a fundamental element of all feature films. One of the most notable CGI films is Avatar (2009).</p>

                <center><img width = "500" src = "images/avatarCGI.png"></center>
                <p>In 1984, Pixar was the first to create a fully computer-generated animation short film, The Adventures of Andre & Wally B.
                  Later, in 1995, they animated the first fully computer-animated feature film, Toy Story.
                  Many animated films are now fully computer-generated such as Despicable Me (2010) and Frozen (2013). </p>
