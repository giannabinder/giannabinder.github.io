Hey there! I've created a website coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript showcasing some of my favourite projects, including formal and creative writing samples, coding projects in various languages, French teaching materials, digital art, AutoCAD drawings, and more. I'm always adding new things, so be sure to check back often! I hope you enjoy it!
